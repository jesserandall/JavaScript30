    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread - take every item out of the iterable and put it into the new one
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heee haww';
    console.log(team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    //create a blank object, pass it the object you wish to copy properties from, then fold in your new properties you want to overwrite
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //works the same way as spreading into an array
    //const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const dev = Object.assign({}, jess);

    //dev.social.twitter = '@dril'
    //console.log(dev.social.twitter);
    //console.log(jess.social.twitter);
